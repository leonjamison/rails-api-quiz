# Rails API Quiz

**Using whatever resources you like (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, lectures, labs, notes, etc.), answer the following questions.**

1. Write the command to create a new Rails application in API mode with a Postgresql database.

ANSWER: rails new project-name-here --api --database=postgresql
```
```

2. What are 5 other options that can be passed in to the `rails new` command and what do they do?
ANSWER: you can run rails new --help to see all options from skipping bundles to runtime options as well
```
```

3. What one line of code can be put into `routes.rb` to get all the RESTful routes for a given resource (e.g., dogs)?

```

4. In the context of API development, what is versioning? How do we implement versioning in a Rails API?

```
```

5. What is serialization in reference to a Rails API?
ANSWER: It changes an object into that string of the api format so that it can be used
```
```

6. Imagine a dog walking domain in which a walker has many dogs. Write the `index` action from the `WalkersController`. Remember, your endpoint should return JSON.

```
```

7. Change the code from the question above so that the walkers' dogs get embedded in the JSON being returned from the `index` endpoint.

```
```

8. Again, change the code above to exclude the timestamps from the data being returned in the JSON.

```
```

9. What does CORS mean? Why do we have to think about it when making an API?
ANSWER: CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing; We have to think about it because it blocks any random JS during a HTTP request

```
```

10. What changes do we have to make in our application to allow CORS?

```
```

11. In our dog walking app, what needs to be added to the following class to allow method calls like `Dog.create(name: "Neikko", breed: "mostly rat", age: 13)` and `Dog.find_by(name: "Neikko")` to function properly?

```
class Dog < ApplicationRecord
end
```

```
```
